// Writing you won array iterations

// You can think of writing array iteration as 3 steps.
// 1. Start by writing grades.forEach()
// 2. Then inside the forEach(), you need to write the function that will be called for every grade: function(grade) {}
// 3. And finally, you add the console.log(grade) inside of that function.

// Putting it all together, you get:

grades.forEach(function (grade) {
  console.log(grade)
})

//Iterate over grades

// Iterate over grades array and log every item in that array to the console.

let grades = [10, 18, 14, 15]

grades.forEach(function (grade) {
  console.log(grade)
})

//Iterate over temperatures

// Iterate over the temperatures array and log every item in that array to the console.

let temperatures = [10, 18, 14, 15]
temperatures.forEach(function (tmeperature) {
  console.log(temperature)
})
