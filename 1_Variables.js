// Programming is the art of writing instruction to the computer such that it achieves your desired task.

// For example, you would like to build a website that acts as a calculator, you will need to use programming to be able to achieve this task.

// Varibles

// A variable is ued to store information so that you can use it and manipulate it later on.

// For example, let's say you want ot aks the user for their age so that you can check if they are eligible to voting in their municipality.  You would need a variable for that.

// Here's how you can define a variable(in JavaScript);

let age = 21

//===========================================================================================================================

// Anatomy of variable declarations

let age1 = 30

// 1. let is a keyword that we used to tell the computer that we want to create a new variable.
// 2. It is then followed by the name of the variable.  In this example we chose age.
// 3. Then followed by the equal sign = which assigns it (or gives it a value).
// 4. 30 is a number that we chose as the value of this variable.

let temperature = 20

// Notice that defining a variable looks more or less like this: let NAME = VALUE;
// Where NAME is the name of the varaible and VALUE is the value you want to give it.

//===========================================================================================================================

// Variable Names

// The name you give to a variable is important as later on you will have several variables in your code and you will need to keep of them and remember waht each varable is responsible for.

// The is why you should always give your variables descriptive names and avoid using single-letter variables such as x, y.

//===========================================================================================================================

// Variable value

// The value of tthe variable is a number that our vairalbe will hold.  This can be changed and manipulated later on.

let temperature1 = 20

// This defines a temperature variable with a value of 20.
// Next time we use the temperature variable, it will be 20.
// But we can change that value to another number, and that will update the value.
// The value can have other types other than numbers.
