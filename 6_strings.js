// Programming languages have what we call data types, these are the different types that variables can hold.

// Here's how you define a variable that contains a string as a value:

let city = 'Amsterdam'

// So a string is a text, a set of characters that ou may write to repreent a name, ciyt, country, description, product title, ect.

// This defines a city variable that is a string.

// Note how the string stars with a double quote " and ends with a double quote ". This is extremely important.  Those quotes have to be there.

// Because if you worte let city = Amsterdam, the programming language will think that Amsterdam is a variable.  Which is not the case.
// We do not have an existing variable called Amsterdam.
// Instead, we literall mean that we want to write the text Amesterdam.  This is why we have to wrap it with double quotes.

//===========================================================================================================================

// String length

// How many characters is your first name?  How many characters is the city where you live?

// This is called the length of a string.  It's a property of any stirng that you define.

let city1 = 'Stckholm'
city.length // this will result in 9

// city.length will return the number 9 because Stockholm is made up of 9 characters.

// .length is a prperty

// .length is a prperty of a string.  In fact, it's the only property on strings.
// The word property means that it's like a characteristic of this string that is already computed.

// When you ask for city.length, the programming language already knows that the length is and wil simply give you that answer.
