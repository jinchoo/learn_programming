// let is only for declaration

// the first time you define a varaible, you have to dfine it with let, however the next time you use that varriable, you should NOT use let anymore.

let year = 2020
year = 2030

//See how afger you define the variable year with let, you can use it by writing its name: year.
// You should NOT use let again as let is only used once when declaring the variable.

//Another example where we dfine 2 variables:
let year1 = 2020
let next = year1 + 1

//Notice how we defined a new varaible called next which is: year1 + 1..

// We only used let once per variable declaration.  So the second line of code had a let because we are defining a new variable next.

// Note that year + 1 does NOT change the value of year, it simply performs an operation and can be seen as 2020 + 1(because 2020 is the value of year1).

// Addition & multiplicaiton

// We've seen the + operator, which returns the value of the 2 numbers on its left and right.

3 + 4 // Adds 3 and 4: 7

let x = 2
let y = 3
x + y // Adds x and y, so in this example 2 + 3: 5

//===========================================================================================================================

// Multiplication operator
// The * is an operator that does the multiplicaiton of the 2 numbers on its left and right.

2 * 4 // Multiplies 2 by 4: 8;

let x1 = 2
let y2 = 3
x1 * y2 // Multiplies x1 by y2: 6

// Note that x1 is not a mutiplcation operator.  So 2 X 5 deos not work.  You have to use the * operator, so that would be 2 * 5;
