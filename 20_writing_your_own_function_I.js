// WRITE YOU OWN FUNCTIONS I

//Function without parameters

// These functions will return a certain string that will always be the same.
// For example, a funciton getWelcomeMessage that will return the string: 'Welcome!'.

// How do we write this function?

function getWelcomeMessage() {
  return 'Welcome!'
}

// Notice How:

// 1.  it stars with keyword funciton followed by a meandatory space character.
// 2. then the name of the funciton getWelcomeMessage(it's case senstive)
// 3. followed by opening and closing parenthesis(). Even though there are no parameters, they are required.
// 4. then you open the curly braces {} and press enter inside of them.  In the code editor, as soon as you write { it will autmatically close it with }. So write { and press enter so that you have:

function getWelcomeMessage() {}
